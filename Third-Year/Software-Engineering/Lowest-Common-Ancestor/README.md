# Lowest Common Ancestor
Our first Software Engineering task is to implement finding the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree in two separate languages. For this task I chose Python and C.

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree and two nodes, we are tasked with finding the lowest common parent of both nodes in the given binary tree. As seen in the diagram below, the lowest common ancestor of node 4 and node 5 is node 2 as both 4 and 5 share this node higher up in the binary tree.
